# PigLatin

To form Pig Latin, you take an English word that begins with a consonant,
move that consonant to the end, and then add “ay” to the end of the word.
If the word begins with a vowel, you simply add “way” to the end of the
word.
Write a program that takes a word as input and uses indexing and
slicing to return its Pig Latin equivalent.
